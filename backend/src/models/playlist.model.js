/**
 * Playlist Model
 *
 * Design Decisions:
 *
 * 1. videos ARRAY OF ObjectIds — not a sub-document array.
 *    Storing only ObjectIds keeps the playlist document lightweight regardless
 *    of how many videos it contains. Full video details are fetched via $lookup
 *    at read time. Sub-documents would duplicate video metadata (title, thumbnail)
 *    here and require updates across playlists whenever a video changes.
 *
 * 2. ORDERING SUPPORT (future-proof):
 *    Array position IS the order. MongoDB preserves array insertion order.
 *    $push appends to end (default add behavior).
 *    $pull removes by value without shifting other positions incorrectly.
 *    Future reorder endpoint can use $set: { videos: newOrderedArray } to
 *    persist a drag-and-drop reorder from the frontend — no schema change needed.
 *
 * 3. DUPLICATE PREVENTION:
 *    NOT enforced via $addToSet at the model level — enforced in the service.
 *    Reason: $addToSet silently ignores duplicates with no error or feedback.
 *    The service explicitly checks and throws ApiError(409) so the frontend
 *    receives a meaningful error message ("Video already in playlist").
 *
 * 4. thumbnail IS OPTIONAL.
 *    Auto-generated from first video's thumbnail in service at read time.
 *    Owners can override with a custom thumbnail (future upload feature).
 *    Storing null by default avoids a required-field problem on empty playlists.
 *
 * 5. visibility "public" | "private" — string enum over boolean.
 *    Boolean (isPrivate) cannot accommodate future states like "unlisted"
 *    (viewable by link, not listed publicly) which YouTube supports.
 *    String enum extends without a schema migration.
 *
 * 6. NO videoCount FIELD.
 *    videos.length at read time is O(1) from the already-loaded array.
 *    A stored counter would require $inc on every add/remove — write overhead
 *    for zero benefit when the array is already in the document.
 *
 * INDEXES:
 *    { owner, createdAt } → "my playlists" page, sorted newest first.
 *    { owner, visibility } → "public playlists by user" filtered query.
 *    No index on videos array — playlist video queries go through
 *    the playlist document itself, not a direct video lookup on this collection.
 *
 * FUTURE MODULES:
 *    Dashboard → countDocuments({ owner: userId }) for playlist analytics.
 *    Recommendations → join Playlist + WatchSession to surface unwatched
 *    playlist videos.
