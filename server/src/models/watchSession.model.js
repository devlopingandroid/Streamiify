/**
 * WatchSession Model
 *
 * Design Decisions:
 *
 * 1. user + video compound unique index → one session document per user per video.
 *    On re-watch, the existing document is updated (upsert), not duplicated.
 *    This keeps the collection size bounded and queries fast.
 *
 * 2. progress (seconds watched) + duration (total video duration) stored together
 *    so completion rate can be calculated without a join to the Video collection.
 *    Dashboard queries stay single-collection and performant.
 *
 * 3. completed is a derived boolean but stored explicitly for fast filtering.
 *    "Continue Watching" = { completed: false, progress: > 0 }
 *    "Watched" = { completed: true }
 *    Recalculating this on every query would be expensive at scale.
 *
 * 4. lastWatchedAt is separate from createdAt/updatedAt.
 *    createdAt = first time user ever watched this video.
 *    lastWatchedAt = most recent watch event (updated on every progress update).
 *    This distinction matters for "recently watched" vs "first watched" analytics.
 *
 * 5. watchCount tracks how many times user has rewatched the same video.
 *    Useful for recommendations ("user rewatched this 3 times").
 *
 * 6. All Dashboard metrics this schema supports without joins:
 *    - Total watch time per user    → sum(progress) where user = X
 *    - Average watch duration       → avg(progress)
 *    - Completion rate              → count(completed=true) / count(*)
 *    - Most watched videos          → group by video, sort by watchCount
 *    - Recently watched             → sort by lastWatchedAt desc
 *    - Watch time per day/week      → group by lastWatchedAt date parts
